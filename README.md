========================================

Hi. Here it is, Lunchbeat made it from breadboard to printed circuit board :)

"lunchbeat-PCB-firmware" contains source C code for Atmega328p 

"lunchbeat-PCB-hardware" contains resources for building Lunchbeat. Schematics, printed circuit board design. And whole Kicad project including library with used parts :)  Kicad is nice free software, use it :)

Feel free to use these files (read license first).

If you use this to create something cool, please let me know! 
If you find any flaw, please let me know!

Thank you, Jan.
