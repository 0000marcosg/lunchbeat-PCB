========================================

Hi. Here it is, Lunchbeat made it from breadboard to printed circuit board :)

"lunchbeat-PCB-firmware" contains source code for Atmega328p 

"lunchbeat-PCB-kicadproject" contains Kicad project :) where you can find schematics and printed circuit board design.

Feel free to use these files (read license first).

If you use this to create something cool, please let me know! 
If you find any flaw, please let me know!
