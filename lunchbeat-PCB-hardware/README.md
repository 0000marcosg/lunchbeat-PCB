This is hardware revision B.
I corrected positions of IC coupling caps.
Everything else remains unchanged.

I added PDF files, one with schematics, and other with PCB design ready to print. PCB design is negative, because I am using dry photoresist method to fabricate PCBs. If you need positive image, you can use free software Inkscape (thats what I used to create these files) to invert what you need.
